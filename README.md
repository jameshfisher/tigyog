# Tigyog

The idea of Togyog is that *the entire state of your project is managed in your
git repository*. In particular this means:

* Your documentation lives next to your code in your repository.
* Your tasks, issues, bugs, and feature requests are tracked right there next to
  your code in your repository.
* Your merge requests and code reviews are tracked in your repository.
* Your access control policies are tracked in the repository.
* Your CI configuration is stored in your repository.
* Your build results are recorded in your repository.
* Your external contributors can contribute directly to subsets of your
  repository.

You might summarize this as Atlassian + Git-as-database.

The expectation is that using the repository that you already manage as the
backing database for all your development management, instead of several
centralized ad-hoc databases, will make things both simpler and more powerful.

Tigyog will succeed to the extent that this is true, possible, and feasible.
